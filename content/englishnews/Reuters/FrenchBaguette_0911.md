## French [**baguette**](#baguette)<a name="baguette_"></a> faces [**pinch**](#pinch)<a name="pinch_"></a> from anti-salt lawmakers

France's [**beloved**](#beloved)<a name="beloved_"></a> bread [**loaf**](#loaf)<a name="loaf_"></a>, the baguette, may be about to lose some of its [**bite**](#bite)<a name="bite_"></a>, with politicians looking into the health risks of [**additives**](#additives)<a name="additives_"></a> set to propose [**legislation**](#legislation)<a name="legislation_"></a> forcing [**bakers**](#bakers)<a name="bakers_"></a> and processed food makers more generally to [**slash**](#slash)<a name="slash_"></a> salt content.

After months of investigation and [**hearings**](#hearings)<a name="hearings_"></a>, a [**parliamentary**](#parliamentary)<a name="parliamentary_"></a> committee has come to the conclusion that [**voluntary**](#voluntary)<a name="voluntary_"></a> agreements on the reduction of high salt levels have not been [**respected**](#respected)<a name="respected_"></a> and that it is time to [**impose**](#impose)<a name="impose_"></a> healthier [**norms**](#norms)<a name="norms_"></a> via legislation.

"It's a real public health problem, " said Loic Prud'homme, one of a 20-member parliamentary committee looking into the matter. Michele Crouzet, another committee member, said the daily [**intake**](#intake)<a name="intake_"></a> of salt in France, at about 10 to 12 grams, is still double the limit recommended by the World Health Organization.

[**Excessive**](#Excessive)<a name="Excessive_"></a> salt levels are linked to [**cardiovascular**](#cardiovascular)<a name="cardiovascular_"></a> trouble, which in France is the second-biggest killer among health problems.

Crouzet said the committee could propose a tax on salt like one already introduced in France on the sugar content of [**fizzy**](#fizzy)<a name="fizzy_"></a> drinks. But some say that [**levy**](#levy)<a name="levy_"></a> has been [**ineffective**](#ineffective)<a name="ineffective_"></a> because [**manufacturers**](#manufacturers)<a name="manufacturers_"></a> are shifting to other forms of [**sweetener**](#sweetener)<a name="sweetener_"></a>.

"What we can now say is that voluntary agreements do not work and it's now time to switch to [**binding**](#binding)<a name="binding_"></a> constraints, " Prud'homme told Reuters.

[**In the case of**](#inthecaseof)<a name="inthecaseof_"></a> the baguette, and bread more generally, voluntary agreements [**struck**](#struck)<a name="struck_"></a> in 2002 had [**sought**](#sought)<a name="sought_"></a> to limit the salt level to 18 grams per kilo of [**flour**](#flour)<a name="flour_"></a> within five years, he said. Some 16 years later, that goal had still not been met.
