Even the light of 200 birthday candles couldn't [**pierce**](#pierce)<a name="pierce_"></a> the [**gloom**](#gloom)<a name="gloom_"></a> of "!Wuthering Heights." But the fire that burned within Emily Brontë [**roars**](#roars)<a name="roars_"></a> across the centuries.

The younger sister of Charlotte, Emily was born on July 30, 1818, in Yorkshire, England. Together with her siblings, Emily [**stoked**](#stoked)<a name="stoked_"></a> a [**furnace**](#furnace)<a name="furnace_"></a> of creativity unique in the [**annals**](#annals)<a name="annals_"></a> of literary history. the children wrote fantastical stories together, [**spinning**](#spinning)<a name="spinning_"></a> imaginary worlds of romantic adventure.

Only [**poetic**](#poetic)<a name="poetic_"></a> [**remnants**](#remnants)<a name="remnants_"></a> of that [**juvenilia**](#juvenilia)<a name="juvenilia_"></a> survive today, but during their brief lives, each of the Brontë sisters managed to publish at least one novel, and none of them generates more [**cultish**](#cultish)<a name="cultish_"></a> [**devotion**](#devotion)<a name="devotion_"></a> than "Wuthering Heights." Yes, Charlotte's "Jane Eyre" may have more readers, but hte [**tale**](#tale)<a name="tale_"></a> of young Catherine and Heathcliff remains the most [**feverish**](#feverish)<a name="feverish_"></a> love story in English literature.

Emily, after all, is the woman who wrote, "No coward soul is mine / No [**trembler**](#trembler)<a name="trembler_"></a> in the world's [**storm-troubled**](#storm-troubled)<a name="storm-troubled_"></a> sphere." And the characters she created are just as fearless, just as [**audacious**](#audacious)<a name="audacious_"></a> in their [**disregard**](#disregard)<a name="disregard_"></a> for what is expected, what is reasonable, what makes sense. The wonder of "Wuthering Heights" is its exponential emotions: "such [**anguish**](#anguish)<a name="anguish_"></a> in the [**gush**](#gush)<a name="gush_"></a> of grief!"

We know Catherine is [**dommed**](#dommed)<a name="dommed_"></a> and Heathcliff is "a [**fierce**](#fierce)<a name="fierce_"></a>, [**pitiless**](#pitiless)<a name="pitiless_"></a>, wolfish man," but how [**subversive**](#subversive)<a name="subversive_"></a>, how [**bewitching**](#bewitching)<a name="bewitching_"></a> such [**unbridled**](#unbridled)<a name="unbridled_"></a> passion feels in our [**self-conscious**](#self-conscious)<a name="self-conscious_"></a> age of [**transactional**](#transactional)<a name="transactional_"></a> [**hookups**](#hookups)<a name="hookups_"></a> and [**enlightened**](#enlightened)<a name="enlightened_"></a> unions. No dating app would ever bring these two lovers together; no marriage algorithm would ever predict a happy future. And yet. ... "He's more myself than I am," Catherine cries. "Whatever our souls are made of, his and mine are the same."
