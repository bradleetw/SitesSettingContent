## One in five [**vanilla**](#vanilla)<a name="vanilla_"></a> ice-creams has no vanilla, cream or fresh milk

Britain's longest heatwave since 1976 [**has seen**](#hasseen)<a name="hasseen_"></a> vanilla ice-cream sales [**soar**](#soar)<a name="soar_"></a>, but a survey has revealed that some brands are sold without vanilla, cream or fresh milk.

Vanilla has traditionally been Britain's [**favourite**](#favourite)<a name="favourite_"></a> [**flavour**](#flavour)<a name="flavour_"></a> but a Which? investigation of supermarket and branded vanilla ice-cream found a number of them were lacking some key [**ingredients**](#ingredients)<a name="ingredients_"></a>.

One in five of the ice-creams examined by the consumer [**watchdog**](#watchdog)<a name="watchdog_"></a> had none of the three ingredients shoppers might reasonably expect to find in vanilla ice-cream. Only half of the 24 surveyed contained all three traditional ingredients.

In a number of the products Which? looked at, cream and milk were [**substituted**](#substituted)<a name="substituted_"></a> with partially [**reconstituted**](#reconstituted)<a name="reconstituted_"></a> [**dried**](#dried)<a name="dried_"></a> [**skimmed**](#skimmed)<a name="skimmed_"></a> milk, and in some cases, [**whey**](#whey)<a name="whey_"></a> [**protein**](#protein)<a name="protein_"></a>. Vanilla was often replaced with a general "[**flavouring**](#flavouring)<a name="flavouring_"></a>".

The price of vanilla soared earlier this year, making it more expensive than silver. It currently sells for around 440 a kilo.

Vanilla has become the second most expensive [**spice**](#spice)<a name="spice_"></a> in the world after [**saffron**](#saffron)<a name="saffron_"></a>, the [**harvesting**](#harvesting)<a name="harvesting_"></a> of which is extremely [**labour-intensive**](#labour-intensive)<a name="labour-intensive_"></a>.

Vanilla beans, which are part of the [**orchid**](#orchid)<a name="orchid_"></a> family, are [**hand-pollinated**](#hand-pollinated)<a name="hand-pollinated_"></a> on family farms. Each flower opens for only part of one day during the season. If it is not pollinated on that day, no [**pod**](#pod)<a name="pod_"></a> is produced. Once picked, the [**curing**](#curing)<a name="curing_"></a> process, which involves drying the beans in the sun by day and allowing them to [**sweat**](#sweat)<a name="sweat_"></a> in a box at night, takes three to six months.

Vanilla is grown in [**tropical**](#tropical)<a name="tropical_"></a> regions. More than 75% is produced in [**Madagascar**](#Madagascar)<a name="Madagascar_"></a>, an island off the south-eastern coast of Africa. The region was [**struck**](#struck)<a name="struck_"></a> by a powerful [**cyclone**](#cyclone)<a name="cyclone_"></a> last month that damaged many [**plantations**](#plantations)<a name="plantations_"></a>.
