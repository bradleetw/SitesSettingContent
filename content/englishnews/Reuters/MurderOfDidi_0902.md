## Murder of Didi passenger [**prompts**](#prompts)<a name="prompts_"></a> China [**clampdown**](#clampdown)<a name="clampdown_"></a>, [**outrage**](#outrage)<a name="outrage_"></a>

China [**pledged**](#pledged)<a name="pledged_"></a> on Monday to [**tighten**](#tighten)<a name="tighten_"></a> [**oversight**](#oversight)<a name="oversight_"></a> of its transport industry and warned that the country did not need [**ride-hailing**](#ride-hailing)<a name="ride-hailing_"></a> firms which [**compromised**](#compromised)<a name="compromised_"></a> on passenger safety, days after a Didi Chuxing passenger was [**raped**](#raped)<a name="raped_"></a> and murdered by her driver.

The killing of a 20-year-old passenger who rode in the Didi vehicle on Friday in the eastern city of Wenzhou is the second such [**incident**](#incident)<a name="incident_"></a> since May, [**denting**](#denting)<a name="denting_"></a> the image of the Beijing-based company, which is the world's largest ride-hailing firm by number of rides and is expanding globally.

Didi [**declined**](#declined)<a name="declined_"></a> to comment on Monday. It has suspended its [**Hitch**](#Hitch)<a name="Hitch_"></a> carpooling service and previously said that it felt deeply responsible and would complete by Sept. 1 a new [**compliance**](#compliance)<a name="compliance_"></a> operation to be [**inspected**](#inspected)<a name="inspected_"></a> by the [**ministries**](#ministries)<a name="ministries_"></a> and the public.

After a 21-year-old flight [**attendant**](#attendant)<a name="attendant_"></a> was murdered in May, [**allegedly**](#allegedly)<a name="allegedly_"></a> by her Didi Hitch driver, the company took steps including limiting the hours during which carpool drivers can pick up passengers of the opposite sex, and testing an "[**escort**](#escort)<a name="escort_"></a> mode" on its app enabling passengers to share their routes and destinations with emergency contacts.

The latest killing has been one of the most discussed topics on China's Twitter-like Weibo service since the weekend, with Didi's official [**apology**](#apology)<a name="apology_"></a> post gaining more than 500,000 comments.

Many Chinese [**netizens**](#netizens)<a name="netizens_"></a> said that they wanted to see key changes being made and that public trust was being [**eroded**](#eroded)<a name="eroded_"></a> as it was not the first incident.

"I don't dare to use Didi in the future," one said.
