## [**Australian**](#Australian)<a name="Australian_"></a> boy who hacked into Apple network admired the group

A 16-year-old boy hacked into Apple's mainframe, downloaded internal files and accessed customer accounts because he was a fan of the company and hoped to work there one day, a Melbourne court has heard.

The boy, who studies in a private school, stored the saved information in a folder titled "hacky hack hack", the newspaper said.

[**Despite**](#Despite)<a name="Despite_"></a> the court being told that the teenager had downloaded 90GB of secure files and accessed customer accounts, Apple - the world's most valuable company - has [**denied**](#denied)<a name="denied_"></a> that customers were affected.

The Age newspaper said customer data had been accessed, and that the boy [**managed to**](#managed_to)<a name="managed_to_"></a> obtain customers' [**authorised**](#authorised)<a name="authorised_"></a> keys - their login access. The boy also shared details of his hacking with members of a WhatsApp group.

Apple would not [**specify**](#specify)<a name="specify_"></a> to Guardian Australia what information had been accessed by the boy, or how they identified the [**breach**](#breach)<a name="breach_"></a>.

The boy [**pleaded**](#pleaded)<a name="pleaded_"></a> guilty and will return to the court for [**sentencing**](#sentencing)<a name="sentencing_"></a> in September.

Dr Suelette Dreyfus, a [**privacy**](#privacy)<a name="privacy_"></a> expert from the University of Melbourne's school of computing and information systems, [**urged**](#urged)<a name="urged_"></a> against a [**punitive**](#punitive)<a name="punitive_"></a> sentence.

"I have researched a number of teen hacker cases internationally," Dreyfus said.

"Young people often make mistakes when they are [**exploring**](#exploring)<a name="exploring_"></a> and rule-breaking especially online - including [**boasting**](#boasting)<a name="boasting_"></a> about their [**exploits**](#exploits)<a name="exploits_"></a>. It's not right, but for tech teens, it can be a part of growing up ... there's usually a really [**worried**](#worried)<a name="worried_"></a> teen and family at the end of this sort of court case."
