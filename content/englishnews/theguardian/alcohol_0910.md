## The Guardian view on [**alcohol**](#alcohol)<a name="alcohol_"></a>: drinking less is good for you

Alcohol is physically bad for you in any quantity; and the more you drink, the worse its health effects. The [**gigantic**](#gigantic)<a name="gigantic_"></a> report on the subject published last week is [**unequivocal**](#unequivocal)<a name="unequivocal_"></a> and [**authoritative**](#authoritative)<a name="authoritative_"></a>. The report was based on [**enormous**](#enormous)<a name="enormous_"></a> amounts of data: 28 million people around the world were examined in 592 studies to estimate the health risks.

The variety of ways in which alcohol can kill or damage people [**comes as**](#comes_as)<a name="comes_as_"></a> a [**shock**](#shock)<a name="shock_"></a>. It is the trade-off between cancer and heart disease which leads the researchers to reject the [**notion**](#notion)<a name="notion_"></a> that [**moderate**](#moderate)<a name="moderate_"></a> drinking has health benefits compared with [**abstinence**](#abstinence)<a name="abstinence_"></a>: they find that the increased risk of cancers [**outweighs**](#outw
eighs)<a name="outweighs_"></a> the [**diminished**](#diminished)<a name="diminished_"></a> risk of heart disease among middle-aged moderate drinkers.

[**Perhaps**](#Perhaps)<a name="Perhaps_"></a> the most [**startling**](#startling)<a name="startling_"></a> single finding is that two-thirds of the world's [**population**](#population)<a name="population_"></a> don't drink at all. They manage without a drug [**apparently**](#apparently)<a name="apparently_"></a> essential to [**civilised**](#civilised)<a name="civilised_"></a> life in the west. The question is whether those of us in the other third should try to [**emulate**](#emulate)<a name="emulate_"></a> them.

Alcohol is bad for judgment and can promote a [**destructive**](#destructive)<a name="destructive_"></a> [**solipsism**](#solipsism)<a name="solipsism_"></a>. But it can also [**stimulate**](#stimulate)<a name="stimulate_"></a> imagination, courage and friendship in a way that is hard to achieve otherwise. There is a reason why wine is tightly linked to paradise in religious [**poetry**](#poetry)<a name="poetry_"></a>. A world without drink might find itself poorer as well as richer.

The report is right that many people should drink less than they do. Perhaps the real benefit of moderate drinking is not that it protects the heart, but that it requires a little [**self-discipline**](#self-discipline)<a name="self-discipline_"></a>.
