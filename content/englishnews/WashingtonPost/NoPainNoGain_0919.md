## 'No pain, no gain' sounds tough, but you may only be hurting yourself

While training for a [**half-marathon**](#half-marathon)<a name="half-marathon_"></a> last fall, Janet Sherman, 57, started noticing pain in her right leg and left foot. A [**diagnosis**](#diagnosis)<a name="diagnosis_"></a> of a [**quadriceps**](#quadriceps)<a name="quadriceps_"></a> [**strain**](#strain)<a name="strain_"></a> and [**plantar**](#plantar)<a name="plantar_"></a> [**fasciitis**](#fasciitis)<a name="fasciitis_"></a> led to [**shoe**](#shoe)<a name="shoe_"></a> [**inserts**](#inserts)<a name="inserts_"></a> and cross-training. Before long, the Wyoming-based teacher was "just good enough" to get back to training, and so she did, although she [**opted to**](#opted)<a name="opted_"></a> drop down to a shorter 10K race distance.

On race day, Sherman's foot began bothering her early, and by a water stop two-thirds of the way through the course, she knew she should drop out. "It was so painful, but I was [**stubborn**](#stubborn)<a name="stubborn_"></a> and finished out the race," she said. "[**Afterward**](#afterward)<a name="afterward_"></a>, I could [**barely**](#barely)<a name="barely_"></a> walk."

To the [**inactive**](#inactive)<a name="inactive_"></a>, Sherman's attitude might be hard to understand. But for [**amateur**](#amateur)<a name="amateur_"></a> [**athletes**](#athletes)<a name="athletes_"></a> and [**weekend warriors**](#weekend_warriors)<a name="weekend_warriors_"></a>, pushing through pain is a common [**refrain**](#refrain)<a name="refrain_"></a>. "As a society, we are more active in sports than ever before," said Adrienne Langelier, a Texas-based sports psychology consultant. "But at the same time, as a culture we have developed a 'no days off' [**mentality**](#mentality)<a name="mentality_"></a>."

Thtat needs to change, said Mark Cucuzzella, a physician and a professor at the West Virginia University School of Medicine. "'No pain, no gain' - no, thank you," he [**quipped**](#quipped)<a name="quipped_"></a>. "For too long, we have [**glamorized**](#glamorized)<a name="glamorized_"></a> that way of thinking. It's not [**sustainable**](#sustainable)<a name="sustainable_"></a>."

Pressing too hard can lead to injury, illness and [**exhaustion**](#exhaustion)<a name="exhaustion_"></a>. With running, for instance, pushing through pain can lead to a [**secondary**](#secondary)<a name="secondary_"></a> injury, said Adam Tenforde of the Spaulding National Running Center at Harvard Medical School. "A stress [**fracture**](#fracture)<a name="fracture_"></a>, if you continue to run on it, may [**progress**](#progress)<a name="progress_"></a> to a full fracture and require a much longer recovery period, for example," he said. "I [**advocate**](#advocate)<a name="advocate_"></a> for addressing pain early, rather than ignoring it."
