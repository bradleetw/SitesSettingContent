## Elon Musk is playing a dangerous game

There is never a [**dull**](#dull)<a name="dull_"></a> moment with the [**mercurial**](#mercurial)<a name="mercurial_"></a> Mr Musk, but he [**excelled**](#excelled)<a name="excelled_"></a> himself on Tuesday, [**stunning**](#stunning)<a name="stunning_"></a> the markets by tweeting that he was considering taking the company private by buying publicly available shares for $420 each - a significant [**premium**](#premium)<a name="premium_"></a> to the $340 they were trading at before he dropped his [**bombshell**](#bombshell)<a name="bombshell_"></a>.

If it [**turns out**](#turns_out)<a name="turns_out_"></a> his Twitter promise - that he has secured the tens of billions of dollars he would need to [**buy out**](#buy_out)<a name="buy_out_"></a> public [**shareholders**](#shareholders)<a name="shareholders_"></a> - is in any way [**shaky**](#shaky)<a name="shaky_"></a>, then he could find himself [**accused**](#accused)<a name="accused_"></a> of price [**manipulation**](#manipulation)<a name="manipulation_"></a>. It's a very serious [**charge**](#charge)<a name="charge_"></a>, which can [**land** you **in**](#land)<a name="land_"></a> [**jail**](#jail)<a name="jail_"></a>.

There is no doubt there is some sense in taking the company private. Private companies are not [**subject to**](#subject_to)<a name="subject_to_"></a> the same [**scrutiny**](#scrutiny)<a name="scrutiny_"></a> from investors, who want to see very transparent earnings on a quarter-by-quarter basis - and if you don't deliver it, your share price can be heavily punished.

Also, Mr Musk did not enjoy having to answer the [**forensic**](#forensic)<a name="forensic_"></a> questioning of Wall Street analysts who want [**minutiae**](#minutiae)<a name="minutiae_"></a> on production, sals, timings, earnings [**et_al**](#et al)<a name="et_al_"></a>. If he takes the company private, he won't have to do this. If it turns out that he doesn't have the financial [**firepower**](#firepower)<a name="firepower_"></a> to deliver on his tweet, the [**regulators**](#regulators)<a name="regulators_"></a> may think he's more than a [**bonehead**](#bonehead)<a name="bonehead_"></a>.
