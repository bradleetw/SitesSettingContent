## The new [**Canon**](#Canon)<a name="Canon_"></a>: the best films of the 2000s

This list advances the [**modest**](#modest)<a name="modest_"></a> proposal that, when it comes to the Canon, we expand our [**notions**](#notions)<a name="notions_"></a> of [**permanence**](#permanence)<a name="permanence_"></a> and [**connoisseurship**](#connoisseurship)<a name="connoisseurship_"></a> to include films that are worthy of appreciation - even [**veneration**](#veneration)<a name="veneration_"></a> - [**despite**](#despite)<a name="despite_"></a> being so recent. (As for rankings, this collection is [**unnumbered**](#unnubered)<a name="unnubered_"></a>, reflecting a [**loose**](#loose)<a name="loose_"></a>, [**intuitive**](#intuitive)<a name="intuitive_"></a> collection rather than a [**strict**](#strict)<a name="strict_"></a> hierachy.) No one is a [**prophet**](#prophet)<a name="prophet_"></a> in their own hometown; sometimes we need reminding that many of the films we're seeing right now are [**genuinely**](#genuinely)<a name="genuinely_"></a> timeless.

"Spirited Away" (2001)

Japanese anime director Hayao Miyazaki seems unable to make anything but [**masterpieces**](#masterpieces)<a name="masterpieces_"></a>; still, this [**epic**](#epic)<a name="epic_"></a> tale of a young girl separated from her parents and [**thrust**](#thrust)<a name="thrust_"></a> into a magical world stands as his greatest - not only for its [**transporting**](#transporting)<a name="transporting_"></a> visuals but also for its [**bracing**](#bracing)<a name="bracing_"></a> sense of adventure, [**terror**](#terror)<a name="terror_"></a>, [**resilience**](#resilience)<a name="resilience_"></a> and [**heroism**](#heroism)<a name="heroism_"></a>. Full of [**whimsy**](#whimsy)<a name="whimsy_"></a>, [**fantasy**](#fantasy)<a name="fantasy_"></a> and childlike [**wonder**](#wonder)<a name="wonder_"></a> - elements that would otherwise feel [**overbearing**](#overbearing)<a name="overbearing_"></a> or [**unforgivably**](#unforgivably)<a name="unforgivably_"></a> [**ersatz**](#ersatz)<a name="ersatz_"></a> - Miyazaki's vision is also [**earthy**](#earthy)<a name="earthy_"></a> and [**profound**](#profound)<a name="profound_"></a>, even at its most [**allegorical**](#allegorical)<a name="allegorical_"></a>.
