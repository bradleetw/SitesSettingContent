## The app [**millennials**](#millennials)<a name="millennials_"></a> are using to look like world travelers on Instagram

Instagram has turned "travel [**bragging**](#bragging)<a name="bragging_"></a> " - posting [**alluring**](#alluring)<a name="alluring_"></a> images from [**exotic**](#exotic)<a name="exotic_"></a> locales to one-up your followers - into something of an art form.

[**Amass**](#Amass)<a name="Amass_"></a> enough followers and you could gain [**influencer**](#influencer)<a name="influencer_"></a> status, allowing you to leverage your "social media [**clout**](#clout)<a name="clout_"></a> to travel the world, frequently in [**luxury**](#luxury)<a name="luxury_"></a> ." That goal may partly explain why [**surveys**](#surveys)<a name="surveys_"></a> from around the world are beginning to show that significant numbers of millennials spend multiple hours a day on their smartphones while traveling and would prefer posting [**jealousy**](#jealousy)<a name="jealousy_"></a> - [**inducing**](#inducing)<a name="inducing_"></a> [**selfies**](#selfies)<a name="selfies_"></a> to photos with loved ones.

Now companies are beginning to [**capitalize**](#capitalize)<a name="capitalize_"></a> on the [**pressure**](#pressure)<a name="pressure_"></a> to post [**awe-inducing**](#awe-inducing)<a name="awe-inducing_"></a> photos on social media as well. Among the most successful is Krome Photos, a photo editing website that uses artificial intelligence to pair people with professional photo editors who can take your images and transform them to make it look like you're anywhere in the world. The cost of edits range between $3 and $12 and most take between 12 or 24 hours.

"In the old days our car or our house represented who we were," said Eduardo Llach, the company's chief executive and founder who compared his employment model to Uber. "Now, your online [**persona**](#persona)<a name="persona_"></a> is everything and people are [**realizing**](#realizing)<a name="realizing_"></a> that photos give you the ability to create whoever you want to be."

For some, Instagram filters are already [**passe**](#passe)<a name="passe_"></a> . Now, Llach noted, people are beginning to [**bypass**](#bypass)<a name="bypass_"></a> conventional filters and editing apps on their smartphone and relying instead on artificial intelligence.
