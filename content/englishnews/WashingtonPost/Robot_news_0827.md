## 'Please do not [**switch** me **off**](#switch)<a name="switch_"></a> !': An experiment with a begging robot shows people [**hesitate**](#hesitate)<a name="hesitate_"></a> to [**pull the plug**](#pull)<a name="pull_"></a>

If a little [**humanoid**](#humanoid)<a name="humanoid_"></a> robot begged you not to [**shut** it **off**](#shut_off)<a name="shut_off_"></a>, would you show [**compassion**](#compassion)<a name="compassion_"></a>?

In an experiment designed to investigate how people treat robots when they act like humans, many participants [**struggled**](#struggled)<a name="struggled_"></a> to power down a [**pleading**](#pleading)<a name="pleading_"></a> robot, named Nao, either refusing to shut it off or taking more than twice the amount of time to pull the plug. The experiment was [**conducted**](#conducted)<a name="conducted_"></a> by researchers in Germany whose findings were published in the scientific [**journal**](#journal)<a name="journal_"></a> PLOS One, the Verge reported this month.

"No! Please do not switch me off! I am scared that it will not [**brighten up**](#brighten_up)<a name="brighten_up_"></a> again!," Nao said to about half of the participants. Nao did not [**object**](#object)<a name="object_"></a> in the other half of the tests so that researchers could measure if his [**pleas**](#pleas)<a name="pleas_"></a> affected how people reacted.

The study builds on existing research that shows humans [**are inclined to**](#inclined)<a name="inclined_"></a> treat electronic media as living [**beings**](#beings)<a name="beings_"></a>. In one [**prior**](#prior)<a name="prior_"></a> experiment, researchers found that test subjects preferred interacting with robots with [**complementary**](#complementary)<a name="complementary_"></a> [**personality**](#personality)<a name="personality_"></a> [**traits**](#traits)<a name="traits_"></a> to their own. And since robots can [**exhibit**](#exhibit)<a name="exhibit_"></a> social traits such as speaking with human voices or taking the shape of a human body, the research suggests that people tend to react "especially social to them."

The researchers said that a possible explanation for their results was that people interpreted Nao's objections as "a sign of [**autonomy**](#autonomy)<a name="autonomy_"></a>." [**In turn**](#In_turn)<a name="In_turn_"></a>, this may have [**boosted**](#boosted)<a name="boosted_"></a> the [**perception**](#perception)<a name="perception_"></a> of the robot as an [**entity**](#entity)<a name="entity_"></a> with humanlike traits, according to the study. By [**expressing**](#expressing)<a name="expressing_"></a> emotions and desires, the experiment showed that the robot [**played on**](#play_on)<a name="play_on_"></a> the participants' [**inclination**](#inclination)<a name="inclination_"></a> to treat electronic media as a social entity, and respond to Nao as if it were alive.
