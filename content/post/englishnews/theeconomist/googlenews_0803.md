# Europe VS Google: high fines, meagre results

. **fine**:(n,v) 罰款 (a,adv) 好的, 健康的

. **meagre**:(a) 貧乏的, 貧弱的, 瘦的

On July 18th the European Commission hit Google with a **record fine**(天價罰款) of €(Euro: 歐元)4.3bn ($5bn) for entrenching its dominance in internet search by illegally tying together this service and other mobile apps with Android, the firm's mobile operating system.

. **commission**:(n) 委員會 (v) 委任

. **entrench**:(n) 確立, 牢固, 鞏固 { trench: 壕溝, en trench 挖出壕溝, 就是鞏固保護 }

. **dominance**:(n) 優勢

The size of the fines hides an inconvenient truth, however. The commission deserves credit for scrutinising the behaviour of dominant online firms - its activism stands in pointed contrast to supine American authorities. However, none of its antitrust actions in recent years has done much to strengthen competition.

. **deserve**:(v) 應得, 應受

. **scrutinise**:(v) 仔細檢查; 細緻觀察

. **dominant**:(a) 佔優勢的

. **activism**:(n) 行動主義; 激進主義

. **stand in contrast to something**: 與某件事形成反差

. **pointed**:(a) 明確的; 直接了當的

. **supine**:(a) 懶散的

. **antitrust**:(n) 反壟斷的, 反托拉斯的

. **strengthen**:(a) 加強的; 強勁的

Depressingly, this outcome may suit everyone. High fines win the commission glowing headlines. Google, for its part, protests loudly but treats the penalty as a cost of doing business. This week's fine amounts to only 5% of Google's current net cash balance. Nothing really changes.

. **depressingly**:(adv) 沮喪地

. **suit**:(v) 適合

. **glowing**:(a) 熱情洋溢的; 熱烈讚揚的

. **amount to**: 相當於, 總計為

. **net cash balance**: 現金結餘淨額

If that sounds cynical, look at the Android case more closely. Google requires smartphone-makers and mobile operators to sign strict agreements if they want to use any of its apps.

. **cynical**:(a) 憤世忌俗的 { cynic: 憤世忌俗者, 憤青 }

. **strict**:(a) 嚴格的

Unsurprisingly, Google argues that these restrictions are for the good of consumers. They ensure, for instance, that people always have a familiar set of apps on their home screen and that Android does not splinter into incompatible versions. Yet what Google calls "fragmentation" is actually competition, and the commission is right to find Google guilty.

. **splinter**:(v) 裂成碎片

. **guilty**:(a) 有罪的

Yet its remedies fall short. Europe is a less friendly environment than America for the tech giants. But it has not so far achieved much more in terms of promoting competition than the *regulators across the Atlantic* (這是指美國的監管單位). That is a disappointment as big as any fine.

. **remedy**:(n) 賠償; 補救 (v) 糾正; 補救

. **fall short**: 不足; 不符合標準

. **giant**:(n) 巨人

. **requlator**:(n) 監管者

. **Atlantic**:(n) 大西洋
