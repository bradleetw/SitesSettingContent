## Test-[doctoring](#Doctoring)<a name="Doctoring_"></a> to keep Japanese women out of medical school

Japan has made a lot of noise in recent years about [**demolishing**](#demolishing)<a name="demolishing_"></a> the traditional view that women should stay at home while men go out to work. So it was shocking when, on August 7th, Tokyo Medical University, a [**prestigious**](#prestigious)<a name="prestigious_"></a> medical school, [**confessed**](#confessed)<a name="confessed_"></a> to marking down the test scores of female applications to keep the ratio of women in each class below 30%.

Their [**defence**](#defence)<a name="defence_"></a> was that women are more likely to [**drop out**](#drop)<a name="drop_"></a> to marry and have children. To judge female applications to medical school purely on their [**merits**](#merits)<a name="merits_"></a> would leave Japan with a shortage of doctors, they said. The [**admission**](#admission)<a name="admission_"></a> has caused [**outrage**](#outrage)<a name="outrage_"></a>.

Doctoring has long been a male [**bastion**](#bastion)<a name="bastion_"></a>. But it is not the only one. Discrimination is [**rife**](#rife)<a name="rife_"></a> in banks and [**trading houses**](#tradinghouses)<a name="tradinghouses_"></a>, where [**stamina**](#stamina)<a name="stamina_"></a> and [**loyalty**](#loyalty)<a name="loyalty_"></a>, qualities somehow associated with men, are [**prized**](#prized)<a name="prized_"></a>, says Mari Miura, a political scientist at Sophia University.

All this [**embarrasses**](#embarrasses)<a name="embarrasses_"></a> a government that has promised to make women "shine", its [**condescending**](#condescending)<a name="condescending_"></a> [**catchphrase**](#catchphrase)<a name="catchphrase_"></a> for female [**empowerment**](#empowerment)<a name="empowerment_"></a>. The policy seems based on the need for more workers rather than on [**genuine**](#genuine)<a name="genuine_"></a> concern for women. Shinzo Abe, the prime minister, says he wants to bring millions more women into the workforce to [**make up**](#makeup)<a name="makeup_"></a> for a labour [**shortfall**](#shortfall)<a name="shortfall_"></a> caused by its [**ageing**](#ageing)<a name="ageing_"></a> and [**declining**](#declining)<a name="declining_"></a> population.

In the filed of politics, the record under Mr Abe's [**premiership**](#premiership)<a name="premiership_"></a> is [**lamentable**](#lamentable)<a name="lamentable_"></a>. Just two members of his [**20-strong**](#strong)<a name="strong_"></a> [**cabinet**](#cabinet)<a name="cabinet_"></a> are women, including Seiko Noda, in charge of women's empowerment. Ms Noda, who makes little secret of her ambition to [**dethrone**](#dethrone)<a name="dethrone_"></a> Mr Abe in a leadership [**contest**](#contest)<a name="contest_"></a> next month, has just published a book called "Grab the Future", her [**manifesto**](#manifesto)<a name="manifesto_"></a> for pulling Japan into line with "global standards". She has almost no chance of winning.
