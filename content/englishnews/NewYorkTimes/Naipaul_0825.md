## V.S. Naipaul, who explored [**colonialism**](#colonialism)<a name="colonialism_"></a> through [**unsparing**](#unsparing)<a name="unsparing_"></a> books, dies at 85

V.S. Naipaul, the [**Nobel**](#Nobel)<a name="Nobel_"></a> [**laureate**](#laureate)<a name="laureate_"></a> who documented the migrations of peoples, the [**unraveling**](#unraveling)<a name="unraveling_"></a> of the British Empire, the [**ironies**](#ironies)<a name="ironies_"></a> of [**exile**](#exile)<a name="exile_"></a> and the [**clash**](#clash)<a name="clash_"></a> between belief and unbelief in more than a dozen unsparing novels and as manay works of nonfiction, died Saturday at his home in Londaon. He was 85.

His family confirmed the death in a [**statement**](#statement)<a name="statement_"></a>, The Associated Press reported.

In many ways [**embodying**](#embodying)<a name="embodying_"></a> the [**contradictions**](#contradictions)<a name="contradictions_"></a> of the [**postcolonial**](#postcolonial)<a name="postcolonial_"></a> world, Naipaul was born of Indian [**ancestry**](#ancestry)<a name="ancestry_"></a> in [**Trinidad**](#Trinidad)<a name="Trinidad_"></a>, went to Oxford University on a scholarship and lived the rest of his life in England, where he [**forged**](#forged)<a name="forged_"></a> one of the most [**illustrious**](#illustrious)<a name="illustrious_"></a> [**literary**](#literary)<a name="literary_"></a> careers of the last half century.

Naipaul [**personified**](#personified)<a name="personified_"></a> a sense of [**displacement**](#displacement)<a name="displacement_"></a>. Having left behind the [**circumscribed**](#circumscribed)<a name="circumscribed_"></a> world of Trinidad, he was never entirely rooted in England. In [**awarding**](#awarding)<a name="awarding_"></a> him the Nobel Prize in literature in 2001, the Swedish [**Academy**](#Academy)<a name="Academy_"></a> described him as "a literary [**circumnavigator**](#circumnavigator)<a name="circumnavigator_"></a>, only ever really at home in himself, in his [**inimitable**](#inimitable)<a name="inimitable_"></a> voice."

Yet his [**existential**](#exitential)<a name="exitential_"></a> [**homelessness**](#homelessness)<a name="homelessness_"></a> was as much willed as [**fated**](#fated)<a name="fated_"></a>. Although he spent his literary career mining his origins, Naipaul [**fiercely**](#fiercely)<a name="fiercely_"></a> [**resisted**](#resisted)<a name="resisted_"></a> the idea of being [**tethered**](#tethered)<a name="tethered_"></a> to a [**hyphen**](#hyphen)<a name="hyphen_"></a>, or to a particular [**ethnic**](#ethnic)<a name="ethnic_"></a> or [**religious**](#religious)<a name="religious_"></a> identity. His guiding [**philosophy**](#phiosophy)<a name="phiosophy_"></a> was [**universalism**](#universalism)<a name="universalism_"></a> which he described as "Our [**Universal**](#Universal)<a name="Universal_"></a> [**Civilization**](#Civilization)<a name="Civilization_"></a>".
