# Trump blasts back after Times publisher decries 'enemy of the people' attacks

Hours after saying he had a "very good meeting" with the publisher of the New York Times about his labelling the press the "enemy of the people", Donald Trump launched a blistering attack on "anti-Trump haters in the dying newspaper industry".

"The failing New York Times and the Amazon Washington Post **do nothing but** write bad stories even on very positive achievements," Trump tweeted. "And they will never change!" Earlier, the White House confirmed Trump met Times' publisher AG Sulzberger on 20 July. Sulzberger then issued a statement that opened an exchange over **whose** activities were more damaging to America.

Sulzberger said he had raised "concerns about the president's deeply troubling anti-press rhetoric" and "implored him to reconsider his broader attacks on journalism, which I believe are dangerous and harmful to our country".

He did not say how the president responded. Hours later, Trump obliged. In a multi-tweet rant, he claimed reports on "internal deliberations of our government ... truly put the lives of many, not just journalists, at risk". Claiming without evidence that "90% of media coverage of my administration is negative", Trump said he would "not allow our great country to be sold out by anti-Trump haters in the dying newspaper industry".

Sulzberger, 37, took over from his father on 1 January. In his statement, he said: "I told the president directly that I thought that his language was not just divisive but increasingly dangerous. I told him that although the phrase 'fake news' is untrue and harmful, I am **far more** concerned about his labelling journalists 'the enemy of the people'."
