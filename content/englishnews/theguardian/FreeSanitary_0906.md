## Scotland to offer free [**sanitary**](#sanitary)<a name="sanitary_"></a> products to all students in world first

Students at schools, colleges and universities across Scotland will have access to free sanitary products as part of a £5.2m [**scheme**](#scheme)<a name="scheme_"></a> to fight [**period**](#period)<a name="period_"></a> [**poverty**](#poverty)<a name="poverty_"></a>.

The [**Scottish**](#Scottish)<a name="Scottish_"></a> government is the first in the world to make sanitary products available free to all of its 395,000 [**pupils**](#pupils)<a name="pupils_"></a> and students to help "[**banish**](#banish)<a name="banish_"></a> the [**scourge**](#scourge)<a name="scourge_"></a> of period poverty" - when girls and women struggle to pay for basic sanitary products on a monthyly basis, significantly affecting their [**hygiene**](#hygiene)<a name="hygiene_"></a>, health and [**wellbeing**](#wellbeing)<a name="wellbeing_"></a>.

A recent survey of more than 2,000 people by Young Scot found that one in four [**respondents**](#respondents)<a name="respondents_"></a> at school, college or university in Scotland struggled to access sanitary products. Moreover, research by the [**grassroots**](#grassroots)<a name="grassroots_"></a> group Women for Independence [**revealed**](#revealed)<a name="revealed_"></a> nearly one in five women had experienced period poverty.

The Scottish government said it worked closely with partners including the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities (Cosla), Colleges Scotland, Universities Scotland and the Scottish Funding Council on the scheme.

The communities secretary, Aileen Campbell, said: "I am proud that Scotland is taking this world-leading action to figth period poverty and I welcome the support of local authorities, colleges and universities in implementing this [**initiative**](#initiative)<a name="initiative_"></a>."

Councillor Alison Evison, the president of Cosla, said while the primary [**aim of**](#aim_of)<a name="aim_of_"></a> the scheme was to ensure no young person [**missed out on**](#missedouton)<a name="missedouton_"></a> their education through a lack of access to sanitary products, "it will also contribute to a more open conversation and reducing the unnecessary [**stigma**](#stigma)<a name="stigma_"></a> associated with periods".
