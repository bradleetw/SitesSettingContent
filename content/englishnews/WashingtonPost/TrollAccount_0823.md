## The strange birth, death and rebirth of a Russian [**troll**](#troll)<a name="troll_"></a> account called "AllForUSA"

An Indiana man named Jesse D. Allen created a website in 2005 with the title AllForUSA.com, [**apparently**](#apparently)<a name="apparently_"></a> to [**pursue**](#pursue)<a name="pursue_"></a> some business interests, but he soon [**abandoned**](#abandoned)<a name="abandoned_"></a> the site. A decade later, at the age of 80, Allen died.

But AllForUSA was just getting started.

As the 2016 presidential [**campaign**](#campaign)<a name="campaign_"></a> [**heated up**](#heated_up)<a name="heated_up_"></a>, AllForUSA.com suddenly [**bristled with**](#bristled)<a name="bristled_"></a> what [**appeared to be**](#appeared)<a name="appeared_"></a> news articles [**celebrating**](#celebrating)<a name="celebrating_"></a> Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and [**bashing**](#bashing)<a name="bashing_"></a> his [**Democratic**](#Democratic)<a name="Democratic_"></a> [**rival**](#rival)<a name="rival_"></a> Hillary Clinton. "HILLARY MAY END UP in PRISON AFTER ALL," read one headline.

On Reddit, the commenter "allforusa" posted similar messages and linked to headlines on AllForUSA.com. The following year, after Trump's election, a Twitter account named "@allforusa11" retweeted the president before [**inexplicably**](#inexplicably)<a name="inexplicably_"></a> changing subjects to tweet about [**feminism**](#feminism)<a name="feminism_"></a> - in Japanese.

The final [**twist**](#twist)<a name="twist_"></a> came a few months later when AllForUSA.com was reborn again - this time as a Russian online [**gambling**](#gambling)<a name="gambling_"></a> site.

A clue to the mystery of this multilingual [**burst**](#burst)<a name="burst_"></a> of activity appeared in a February [**indictment**](#indictment)<a name="indictment_"></a> by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III. It said the Russians who operated fake social media accounts to manipulate American voters used allforusa@yahoo.com to [**fraudulently**](#fraudulently)<a name="fraudulently_"></a> access a PayPal account and to promote a "[**March**](#march)<a name="march_"></a> for Trump" campaign [**rally**](#rally)<a name="rally_"></a> in New York.

The other "AllForUSA" accounts probably were operated [**in tandem**](#tandem)<a name="tandem_"></a> with this email address and with each other, according to a report Monday from cyberintelligence form GroupSense, whose researchers found a [**subtle**](#subtle)<a name="subtle_"></a> [**tangle**](#tangle)<a name="tangle_"></a> of connections left in records discovered online.

The report highlights how [**data breaches**](#breaches)<a name="breaches_"></a> [**fuel**](#fuel)<a name="fuel_"></a> [**nefarious**](#nefarious)<a name="nefarious_"></a> online activity, giving criminal hackers and [**disinformation**](#disinformation)<a name="disinformation_"></a> teams an endless supply of cheap accounts to use individually or for networks of "bots", automated accounts controlled by a single operative. All this typically [**takes place**](#takes_place)<a name="takes_place_"></a> without the original owners knowing what happened to their creations.
