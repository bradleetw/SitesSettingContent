"Mission: Impossible - Fallout," starring Tom Cruise, 56, and made by Paramount Pictures, could have easily turned into a sad commentary on the state of moviedom in the age of Marvel and Netflix. Instead, "Fallout" arrived as a cultural thunderclap, receiving joyous reviews from critics, stirring lively ticket-buyer conversation online and taking in a stout $61.5 million over its first three days in North American theaters. Overseas, "Fallout" collected an additional $92 million.

"I'm seeing the numbers come in from around the world, and they're just fantastic," Jim Gianopulos, who took over as Paramount's chairman last year, said by telphone early Sunday from Greece, where he has a home.

The 22-year-old "Mission: impossible" film series, which is based on the 52-year-old TV show, does not have the same financial power it once did. The reception for "Fallout" was impressive nonetheless, improving on opening-weekend ticket sales for its 2015 predecessor, "Rogue Nation," even after adjusting for inflation. "Fallout" also received stronger reviews-an achievement of critical importance for the franchise going forward; if audiences are satisfied with one sequel, they are likely to go to the next one.
