## Pentagon is [moving toward](#movetoward)<a name="movetoward_"></a> establishing Trump's Space Force

The Pentagon is moving toward [**fulfilling**](#fulfilling)<a name="fulfilling_"></a> President Donald Trump's request to establish a Space Force, [**in what**](#inwhat)<a name="inwhat_"></a> would be the first new [**branch**](#branch)<a name="branch_"></a> of the military in more than 70 years.

In a speech at the Pentagon Thursday at 11:15 a.m., Vice President Mike Pence [**is scheduled to**](#bescheduled)<a name="bescheduled_"></a> [**lay out**](#layout)<a name="layout_"></a> the administration's plan. The Pentagon is also expected to release a [**Congressionally-mandated**](#Congressionally-mandated)<a name="Congressionally-mandated_"></a> report on the issue.

But the [**calls**](#calls)<a name="calls_"></a> for a separate military branch have been met with strong [**reluctance**](#reluctance)<a name="reluctance_"></a> in some parts of the Pentagon [**amid**](#amid)<a name="amid_"></a> concerns that it doesn't need the [**burdens**](#burdens)<a name="burdens_"></a> of a new [**bureaucracy**](#bureaucracy)<a name="bureaucracy_"></a>. The move could significantly reorganize the military and potentially [**strip**](#strip)<a name="strip_"></a> the Air Force of some of its key reponsibilities.

Congressional approval would be needed to [**stand up**](#standup)<a name="standup_"></a> an entirely new military branch. A Space Force, dedicated [to space the way the Navy is to the sea](#analogy)<a name="analogy_"></a>, would be the first new military service since the Air Force was created in 1947. But Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said that creating a new [**combatant**](#combatant)<a name="combatant_"></a> command for space, such as one that governs the Pentagon's Special Operations "is certainly one thing that we can establish."

Military leaders have said repeatedly that modern [**warfare**](#warfare)<a name="warfare_"></a> depends on space. The Pentagon and [**intelligence**](#intelligence)<a name="intelligence_"></a> community has a [**host of**](#hostof)<a name="hostof_"></a> sensitive satellites that perform all sorts of [**vital**](#vital)<a name="vital_"></a> national security tasks, such as [**missile**](#missile)<a name="missile_"></a> warning, precision-guided [**munitions**](#munitions)<a name="munitions_"></a>, military communications, intelligence.
