## FBI seeks motive after U.S. airline worker steals plane, crashes it

A Horizon Air [**ground service agent**](#ground_service)<a name="ground_service_"></a> got into a Bombardier Q400 [**turboprop**](#turboprop)<a name="turboprop_"></a> aircraft on Friday night in a maintenance area at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport and [**took off**](#took_off)<a name="took_off_"></a>, Horizon sister [**carrier**](#carrier)<a name="carrier_"></a> Alaska Airlines said.

He [**flew**](#flew)<a name="flew_"></a> for about one hour, often [**erratically**](#erratically)<a name="erratically_"></a> with attempts at [**aerial**](#aerial)<a name="aerial_"></a> [**stunts**](#stunts)<a name="stunts_"></a>, before crashing onto [**sparsely**](#sparsely)<a name="sparsely_"></a> [**populated**](#populated)<a name="populated_"></a> Ketron Island in Puget Sound, some 25 miles to the southwest. The 29-year-old man was [**suicidal**](#suicidal)<a name="suicidal_"></a> and appeared to have acted alone, according to [**authorities**](#authorities)<a name="authorities_"></a>. He was believed to have been killed in the crash.

Relatives and co-workers [**identified** the man **as**](#identified)<a name="identified_"></a> Richard Russell of Summer, Washington. "This is a complete shock to us. We are [**devastated**](#devastated)<a name="devastated_"></a> by these events and Jesus is truly the only one holding this family together right now, " the family said.

Russell was not known to have had a pilot's license, Horizon Air Chief Executive Gary Beck said at a news conference, and it was not clear how he was able to take off and fly as he did. "There were some [**maneuvers**](#maneuvers)<a name="maneuvers_"></a> that were done that were incredible maneuvers with the aircraft," Beck said.

In partial recordings of Russell's conversations with air traffic controllers that were published online by Broadcastify.com, he said he was sorry to [**disappoint**](#disappoint)<a name="disappoint_"></a> people who cared about him and described himself as a "broken guy."

The FBI is leading the [**probe**](#probe)<a name="probe_"></a>, which also includes the Federal Aviation Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board. "We are going to be [**thorough**](#thorough)<a name="thorough_"></a>, which means taking the time needed to [**scour**](#scour)<a name="scour_"></a> the area, [**delve into**](#delve)<a name="delve_"></a> the background of the individual believed responsible, and review every aspect of this [**incident**](#incident)<a name="incident_"></a> with all appropriate public & private partners," the FBI said in a statement.
