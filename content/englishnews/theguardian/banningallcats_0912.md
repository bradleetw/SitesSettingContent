## [**Paw**](#paw)<a name="paw_"></a> outcome? New Zealand [**council**](#council)<a name="council_"></a> proposes [**banning**](#banning)<a name="banning_"></a> all cats

A regional council in New Zealand has proposed banning all [**domestic**](#domestic)<a name="domestic_"></a> cats [**in an attempt to**](#inanattemptto)<a name="inanattemptto_"></a> protect native animals.

Environment Southland's "[**pest**](#pest)<a name="pest_"></a> plan" calls for all domestic cats in the region to be [**neutered**](#neutered)<a name="neutered_"></a>, [**microchipped**](#microchipped)<a name="microchipped_"></a> and registered. Then, when a cat dies, residents would not be permitted to have another.

Ali Meade, the council's biosecurity operations manager, said that if the move was approved the improvement for the environment and bird life would be [**vast**](#vast)<a name="vast_"></a>.

Omaui resident Nico Jarvis told the Otago Daily Times that she was shocked and planned a [**petition**](#petition)<a name="petition_"></a> against the plan, She said that her three cats were the only way to combat a [**rodent**](#rodent)<a name="rodent_"></a> problem in the area. "If I cannot have a cat, it almost becomes unhealthy for me to live in my house, " she said.

Jarvis likened the plan to living in a "police state ... It's not even [**regulating**](#regulating)<a name="regulating_"></a> people's ability to have a cat. It's saying you can't have a cat."

The move comes as New Zealand works on an [**ambitious**](#ambitious)<a name="ambitious_"></a> goal to become [**predator-free**](#predator-free)<a name="predator-free_"></a> by 2050. That plan is [**devoted**](#devoted)<a name="devoted_"></a> to [**wiping out**](#wiping)<a name="wiping_"></a> introduced [**species**](#species)<a name="species_"></a> of rats, [**stoats**](#stoats)<a name="stoats_"></a> and [**possums**](#possums)<a name="possums_"></a>.

Economist turned parliamentary candidate Gareth Morgan has long proposed wiping out cats from New Zealand as a way to protect native species from what he called "natural born killers".
