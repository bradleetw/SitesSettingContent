## Recommendations from Jeff
- Demonstrate you can do data analysis and focus on becoming really skilled at machine learning.

- Invest in your communication skills. I recommend reading the book **Made to Stick** to help your ideas have more impact. Also check out the **Hemmingway Editor** app to improve the clarity fo your writing.

- **Master a deep learning framework**. Being proficient with a deep learning framework is a larger and larger part of being proficient with machine learning.

- If you are choosing between larning Python and R, choose Python. If you have Python down cold, consider learning R. You'll definitely be more marketable if you also know R.
